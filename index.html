    <!-- =================== ABSTRACT =================== -->
    <hr>
    <h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
    <pre class="ex1" id="Abstract_InText">
When exercising some people assume we lift weight, we eat more, and we get bigger. Well in complete simplicity it can be true, however like all things in this world physics plays a major role. Understanding this physics can help optimise our lifting experience by improving safety and improving growth through better knowledge. The main ideas of “eating” and “lifting” can be explained by the further ideas within this article, chosen with the intention of giving the most important information to best explain them as concisely as possible, The “CICO” section explains to us the energy conservation behind eating food and energy used by individuals (physically) and how it can be different for everyone. The “forces and moments in lifting” highlights the core mechanics behind weightlifting allowing for more safety and better performance.#
“Bench physics” serves to be an example to this idea by applying physics to a specific excercise.


    <!-- =================== CICO SECTION =================== -->
    <hr>
    <h3 id="CICO">Calories In / Calories Out Debate</h3>
    <pre class="ex1">
Calories in calories out is a framework that states calories in (from food sources) will be equal to the calories outputted by an individual in various ways, which can be for their daily activities, metabolic activity (“general energy for body upkeep”), thermic effect of food (“digesting food energy spent”). This principle follows the conservation of energy (energy can’t be created or destroyed), so excess calories not used as the body is stored as extra mass (fat or muscle) showing this principle obeys physics. However, the effective calories consumed by a person can differ between different individuals.
Demonstrated on the table are 3 individuals intaking the same calories with different BMR and different TEF (thermic effect of food). The trained individual has a higher BMR (which is dependent on the “weight” of a person) someone who is trained has more muscles  larger mass  larger BMR. In addition to this they experience a larger TEF this means there are less calories remaining for their BMR and any physical activities as compared to someone who is sedentary who would have more available. On the other hand, someone with a digestive inefficiency would also have less calories available after TEF meaning they would need extra calories to compensate for this loss. The examples show that people, even though they are following the same calorie goal, might experience different outcomes for their weight gain, loss or maintenance.
CICO arguably is still very useful because the body has so many factors involved in energy consumption, but it should still be acknowledged as an approximation. This shows when trying to gain or lose weight if no change occurs, then a change in calorie calculation is required (i.e. increase calories if not increasing weight and decrease if not losing weight). The table supports that there is biological variability across and no flaw in physics and this is the reason calorie responses vary between individuals. 
*It should be noted that when calculating BMR online it only considers “weight” this is crucial because overall muscle has a higher metabolic activity than fat (it burns more energy to have it) meaning your BMR could be higher or lower than expected, once again reinforcing that CICO itself is an approximation.

    <!-- =================== FORCES & MOMENTS =================== -->
    <hr>
    <h3 id="ForcesMoments">Forces and Moments in Weightlifting</h3>
    <pre class="ex1">
[Introduce the basic physics:
- Force (F) and mass (m)
- Work done: W = F × d
- Moments / torque: M = F × perpendicular distance (moment arm)
Explain why joints act as pivots and muscles generate internal moments to
balance the external moment from the weight.]

<!-- DIAGRAM REMINDER:
    Add a diagram of a simple lever:
    - Show pivot (joint)
    - Applied force
    - Distance from pivot (moment arm)
    - Direction of rotation (moment arrow)
-->
    </pre>

    <!-- =================== BENCH PRESS PHYSICS (LIMB LENGTH) =================== -->
    <hr>
    <h3 id="BenchPressPhysics">Bench Press Physics: Limb Length</h3>
    <pre class="ex1">
[Explain how longer arms increase the moment at the shoulder and/or elbow:
- Same weight but longer horizontal distance → larger moment.
- Longer arms also mean a greater vertical distance the bar has to travel,
  so more work is done: W = F × d.
Make the link between limb length and perceived difficulty of the lift.]

<!-- DIAGRAM REMINDER:
    Add a diagram comparing:
    - Short-arm lifter vs long-arm lifter
    - Different bar path distances
    - Different moment arms for the same weight
-->

    <!-- =================== EXPLOSIVITY (F = ma) =================== -->
    <hr>
    <h3 id="Explosivity">Training Explosivity (F = ma)</h3>
    <pre class="ex1">
[Connect strength training to Newton's second law: F = m a.
If training increases the maximum force muscles can produce,
then for a given mass (barbell or body) the acceleration can increase.
Use a jumping or squat example:
- Larger force generated in a short time → greater change in velocity,
  higher jump, faster bar speed, more "explosive" movement.]

<!-- DIAGRAM REMINDER:
    Option 1: Graph of force vs acceleration.
    Option 2: Arrows showing increased force leading to higher acceleration
              and greater jump height or bar speed.

    <!-- =================== PULLEY SYSTEMS =================== -->
    <hr>
    <h3 id="Pulleys">Pulley Systems in Gym Equipment</h3>
    <pre class="ex1">
[Describe how pulleys change the effective load:
- Mechanical advantage (more rope segments sharing the load).
- How some machines feel "lighter" or "heavier" for the same weight stack.
- Mention friction losses in pulleys and cables, which reduce efficiency.]

<!-- DIAGRAM REMINDER:
    Add a pulley diagram showing:
    - A simple fixed pulley (no mechanical advantage, just direction change).
    - A two-pulley system where the user effectively lifts only a fraction
      of the load.
    - Indicate input force vs output force.

    <!-- =================== ANALYSIS & DISCUSSION (USED FOR WORD COUNT) =================== -->
    <hr>
    <h3 id="Analysis">Analysis and Discussion</h3>
    <pre class="ex1" id="Analysis_InText">
[Bring ideas together:
- How CICO provides a useful framework but must be personalised.
- How biomechanics (moments, limb length) make lifts harder or easier.
- Why explosive training relates directly to F = ma.
- How pulley systems change the relationship between external load and
  internal muscle force.
You can summarise key comparisons or link back to real lifter experiences.]

    <pre class="ex1">
[Reflect on the peer feedback you received:
- Need more visual demonstration of physics → you are adding diagrams.
- Need clearer explanation of physics concepts before applying them.
- Need to explain gym jargon (ROM, PR, hypertrophy, etc.) for non-gym
  readers.
Explain how you have addressed or will address these points.]

    <hr>
    <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
    <pre class="ex1" id="Conclusion_InText">
[Summarise the main physics insights:
- Energy balance (CICO) is constrained by conservation of energy, but
  biological differences mean practical outcomes vary between people.
- Forces, moments, and limb length explain why some lifters find certain
  movements harder.
- F = m a and explosive training show how physics underpins athletic
  performance.
- Pulley systems demonstrate mechanical advantage and real-world
  applications of simple machines in the gym.
