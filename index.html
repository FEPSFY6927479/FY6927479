    <!-- =================== ABSTRACT =================== -->
    <hr>
    <h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
    <pre class="ex1" id="Abstract_InText">
When exercising, many people assume that lifting weights and eating more automatically lead to muscle growth. While there is some truth to this, physics plays a major role in how efficiently these processes occur. Understanding these physical principles can improve both performance and safety. This article focuses on three key areas: energy balance through the Calories In / Calories Out (CICO) framework, the biomechanics of weightlifting, and how force production influences explosivity. The CICO section explains how individuals with different metabolic rates and thermic effects of food can respond differently to identical calorie targets (Hall et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2010). The biomechanics sections examine how forces and moments influence lifting difficulty, and how limb length changes the mechanical demands of movements such as the bench press (Escamilla, 2001). Finally, the explosivity section links resistance training adaptations to an increased rate of force development, described by fundamental physics principles (Aagaard et al., 2002). Together, these ideas demonstrate how physics underpins both technique and physical progress in weightlifting.

    <pre class="ex1" id="Introduction_InText">
[In this section you can briefly introduce why physics is relevant to bodybuilding and weightlifting. For example, you might outline that the article will look at energy balance (CICO), the forces and moments acting on the body during lifts, how limb length changes mechanical disadvantage, and how strength training affects the rate of force development. You can also mention that understanding these principles can help lifters make sense of differences between individuals and make more informed training decisions.]

    <!-- =================== CICO SECTION =================== -->
    <hr>
    <h3 id="CICO">Calories In / Calories Out Debate</h3>
    <pre class="ex1" id="CICO_InText">
Calories In / Calories Out (CICO) describes energy balance in the body and is based on the conservation of energy: calories consumed must either be used, stored, or lost. Energy output includes basal metabolic rate (BMR), daily physical activity, and the thermic effect of food (TEF). While this framework is valid, individuals differ significantly in how many calories they actually expend (Hall et al., 2011).

The table illustrates three people consuming the same calorie intake but experiencing different usable energy due to differences in BMR and TEF. A trained individual typically has a higher BMR because muscle tissue is more metabolically active than fat, meaning they burn more calories at rest (Wang et al., 2010). This leaves fewer calories “left over” for weight gain compared to a sedentary person, who has a lower BMR and lower TEF. Someone with digestive inefficiencies may also absorb fewer calories overall, demonstrating that intake does not always equal usable energy.

These variations explain why two people following the same calorie target may not see the same progress. CICO remains a useful framework, but it should be treated as an approximation because metabolic rate, digestion, and body composition all influence how calories are processed. Practically, this means individuals should adjust their calorie intake if they are not losing or gaining weight as expected, rather than assuming the original calculation is universally accurate.

    <hr>
    <h3 id="ForcesMoments">Forces and Moments in Weightlifting</h3>
    <pre class="ex1" id="ForcesMoments_InText">
        

The things we exercise with (barbells/dumbbells) have mass therefore they have a weight
*Different for cables which use pulleys (have tension as force instead) follow hooks law still (F = ma)
Weight = Mass x g (acceleration due to gravity) (F= ma)
As a result, when moving theses weights work done (energy) is required hence: Work done (energy) = Force x Distance (in the same direction)
Our muscles must produce an internal force larger than the force generated by the (weight/cable) to complete the intended movement. The force is outputted through our bones and joints which can turn and therefore act as “biological levers”
Since in most lifts the weight is not at the joint but is at some horizontal distance away 
(e.g. dumbbell curl) there is some form of perpendicular distance.
Moment (m) = Force x distance
	A larger moment arm (arm that would have a larger moment explained in next section) means more torque to counter therefore internal torque required is larger to move or hold weight so certain movements can be made easier or harder based on positioning of arms (explained in next section)

    <!-- =================== BENCH PRESS PHYSICS (LIMB LENGTH) =================== -->
    <hr>
    <h3 id="BenchPressPhysics">Bench Press Physics: Limb Length</h3>
    <pre class="ex1" id="BenchPress_InText">
[Explain how longer arms increase the moment at the shoulder and/or elbow:
- For the same barbell weight, a lifter with longer arms usually has a larger horizontal distance from the shoulder joint to the line of action of the load.
- Since the external moment is M = F × d⊥, a larger distance d⊥ means a larger moment that the shoulder muscles must counter (Escamilla, 2001).
- Longer arms also mean a greater vertical distance for the bar to travel, so more work is done: W = F × d. This helps explain why some lifters feel that bench press is harder despite using the same load as someone with shorter arms.

You can relate this to real lifter experiences, for example why leverages and body segment lengths can affect which lifts an athlete is naturally better at (Escamilla, 2001).]

    <hr>
    <h3 id="Explosivity">Training Explosivity (Rate of Force Development)</h3>
    <pre class="ex1" id="Explosivity_InText">
In physics terms, moving a weight explosively is about producing a large force on the bar in a short time. From Newton’s second law, F = ma, if a lifter can generate a higher peak force with their muscles, the same load can be given a larger acceleration. In practice this shows up as faster bar speed in a squat or bench press and a higher take-off velocity in a vertical jump. Resistance training does not just make muscles bigger; it can also increase the rate of force development through changes in neural drive and motor unit recruitment (Aagaard et al., 2002). This is why explosive exercises such as jumps, Olympic lift variations and fast concentric phases are often included when the goal is to improve power rather than only slow, maximal strength.

    <!-- =================== ANALYSIS & DISCUSSION (USED FOR WORD COUNT) =================== -->
    <hr>
    <h3 id="Analysis">Analysis and Discussion</h3>
    <pre class="ex1" id="Analysis_InText">
[Bring the ideas from all sections together:
- CICO shows that energy balance follows the conservation of energy, but real people have different BMR and thermic effects of food, so they respond differently to the same calorie target (Hall et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2010).
- Biomechanics explains why some lifters find certain movements harder due to lever arms and joint moments (Escamilla, 2001).
- Rate of force development links strength training and explosivity to basic physics through F = ma (Aagaard et al., 2002).

You can discuss how using physics-based reasoning helps lifters set more realistic expectations and avoid comparing themselves unfairly to others who may have different body segments or metabolic rates. You might also comment on how this understanding could influence training choices, for example, whether to focus on technique, hypertrophy, or power work.]

[Reflect on the peer feedback you received:
- Need more visual demonstration of physics → you are adding diagrams alongside each main physics concept (moments, work done, rate of force development).
- Need clearer explanation of physics concepts before applying them → your forces and moments section now introduces the basic definitions before they are used in the bench press and explosivity sections.
- Need to explain gym jargon (ROM, PR, hypertrophy, deload, etc.) for non-gym readers → you can briefly define any gym-specific terms when they first appear.

Explain how you have addressed or will address these points, showing that the feedback has helped improve the clarity and accessibility of your paper.]

    <!-- =================== CONCLUSION =================== -->
    <hr>
    <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
    <pre class="ex1" id="Conclusion_InText">
[Summarise the main physics insights:
- Energy balance (CICO) is constrained by conservation of energy, but biological differences in BMR and digestion mean that calorie responses vary across people (Hall et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2010).
- Forces, moments, and limb length explain why some lifters find certain movements harder and why technique and leverages matter (Escamilla, 2001).
- F = ma and rate of force development show how physics underpins explosive performance and why training can increase both maximum force and how quickly it is produced (Aagaard et al., 2002).

You can also briefly mention limitations (for example, that the paper simplifies some biological details) and possible extensions such as looking at injury mechanics or comparing free weights to machines in more detail.]
